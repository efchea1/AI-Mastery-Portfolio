## 👤 About Me

I'm Emmanuel Fle Chea, a public health data scientist and AI builder committed to designing ethical, deployable systems that advance global health equity. My work bridges technical innovation with societal impact, especially in underserved communities, through transparent documentation, real-world projects, and mission-driven collaboration

## 🌍 Why This Portfolio Matters

This portfolio is more than technical training, it's a mission-driven journey to build AI systems that serve public health, equity, and global resilience. Each project is designed to be:
- **Ethical**: Transparent, fair, and explainable
- **Deployable**: Built with CI/CD, Docker, and real-world datasets
- **Impactful**: Aligned with NIH, WHO, and national security priorities

**By January 2026**, this portfolio supports my transition into AI and public health innovation roles, and lays the foundation for future research and leadership in ethical AI systems for global health.
